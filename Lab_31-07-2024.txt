1. pseudocode for calculating the total cost of items in a shopping cart, including applying a discount if the total exceeds a certain amount.

BEGIN
    DECLARE items AS ARRAY OF FLOAT
    DECLARE total AS FLOAT
    DECLARE discount AS FLOAT
    DECLARE finalTotal AS FLOAT
    DECLARE threshold AS FLOAT
    DECLARE discountRate AS FLOAT
 
    SET items = [item1, item2, item3, ..., itemN]  // Assume item1, item2, etc., are the       prices of the items
    SET total = 0.0
    SET threshold = 100.0  // Example threshold amount for discount
    SET discountRate = 0.10  // Example discount rate of 10%
 
    FOR EACH item IN items
        total = total + item
    END FOR
 
    IF total > threshold THEN
        discount = total * discountRate
    ELSE
        discount = 0
    END IF
 
    finalTotal = total - discount
 
    PRINT "Total before discount: ", total
    PRINT "Discount applied: ", discount
    PRINT "Total after discount: ", finalTotal
END


2.pseudocode for a simple calculator that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input and outputs the result of the operation.

double number1
double number2
input char operator(=,-,*,/)
if operator == '+'
	double result=number1 + number2
else if operator == '-'
	double result=number1 - number2
else if operator == '*'
	double result=number1 * number2
else operator == '/'
	double result=number1 / number2
return result
  

3.Write pseudocode for the FizzBuzz problem: For numbers 1 to 100, print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.

int i

for i from 1 to 100
   if ((i % 3== 0)and(i % 5 == 0))
      print"FizzBuzz"
   else  if i % 3== 0
      print "Fizz"
   else if i % 5 == 0
     print "Buzz"
   
   end if  



4.Write pseudocode to check if a given string is a palindrome.

input string
set rev=''
for i string
	rev=i+rev
end for
if rev==string
	print'palindrome'
else
	print'not palindrome'
endif

5. Write pseudocode to find the maximum value in an array of integers.

input an IntegerArray 'A'
Integer max_value = A[0] 
for each Integer x in A
    If x > max_value
        max_value = x 

Print max_value 

6.pseudocode to manage a simple bank account that allows deposits, withdrawals, and checking the balance.

Initialize double balance = 0

Function Deposit(amount)
    if amount > 0
        balance = balance + amount
        print amount
    else
        print "Invalid deposit amount"

Function Withdraw(amount)
    if amount > 0 AND amount <= balance
        balance = balance - amount
        print amount
    else
        print "Invalid withdrawal amount"

function CheckBalance()
    return balance


#Write pseudocode to find sum of first N even numbers.

BEGIN
    DECLARE n AS INTEGER
    DECLARE i AS INTEGER
    DECLARE sum AS INTEGER
    FOR i in range(1,n+1)
	IF i % 2 == 0
	    sum = sum + i
        END IF
    END FOR
    PRINT sum 
END
